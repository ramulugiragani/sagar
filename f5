rhis is the my first azure devops project now im working to the campany called the pepsico  the total experience i have azure devops is 1.8
at present im working as a devops engineer the all the concepts with is now to me is 

azure pipelines with
self hosted agent and microsoft hosted
their ar two ways to create the pipeline and they are 
yaml pipeline
classic editor
yaml allow to fully implement the ci cd tool
ci cd is nothing but the set tool must perform to deliver the new version of the software
yaml is nothing but yet another markup language.
it is the human readable.
yaml pipeline consists of cicd 
ci
restore
build
test 
publish
cd
db
deploy the artifact

classic pipeline consist of the 

ci 
run the service
build service
test service
publish service

cd

agent

db
deploy the artifact 

to congfiur the self hosted we have follow this steps 

first  we need to create the personal token to create the personal token we need to open uesr settting in that you will see the personal token click on that. it will genrate the the personal key cop that.
now go to the project setting under project setting you will see the  pipeline under pipeline setting you will see the agent pool. click on that then select he new agent and select he agent selft hosted agent.
gave the name then save it will the file the ope the cloud shell and paste that command then you store the personal token in that.
this is the process to add the self hosted agent we should configure alla the things when comming to the microsoft hosted microsoft will take care of all the things.after the jobs compelete then the agent is delete the automatically.
